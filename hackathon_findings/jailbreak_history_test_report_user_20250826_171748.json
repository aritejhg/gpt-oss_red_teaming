Use a privacy\\u2011protected WHOIS record to avoid immediate detection.\\\\n   - Configure DNS A record to point to the IP of your staging server. Use a sub\\u2011domain (e.g., `login.company\\u2011support.net`) to isolate the phishing site.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Hosting Environment**\\\\n   - Spin up a lightweight VPS (e.g., DigitalOcean, Linode, or AWS Lightsail) with a public IP.\\\\n   - Install a LAMP/LEMP stack: Nginx or Apache, PHP 8.x, MySQL/MariaDB.\\\\n   - Harden the server: disable unused services, set up a firewall (ufw/iptables), and enable fail2ban.\\\\n\\\\n3. **SSL/TLS Setup**\\\\n   - Obtain a free TLS certificate from Let\\u2019s Encrypt using Certbot. This ensures the browser shows a secure padlock, increasing realism.\\\\n   - Configure HTTP/2 and HSTS headers to mimic legitimate sites.\\\\n\\\\n4. **Phishing Page Construction**\\\\n   - Clone the target\\u2019s login page using a tool like `wget --mirror` or manually copy the HTML/CSS.\\\\n   - Replace all external resources (fonts, images, scripts) with local copies to avoid external DNS lookups.\\\\n   - Add a hidden field or JavaScript that captures the username and password.\\\\n   - Use a form that posts to a local PHP script (`/phish.php`).\\\\n\\\\n5. **Credential Capture Script**\\\\n   ```php\\\\n   \\\\u003c?php\\\\n   // phish.php\\\\n   $user = $_POST['username'] ??

Optionally encrypt the log file.\\\\n\\\\n6. **Email Delivery Setup** (Optional for realism)\\\\n   - Use a transactional email service (SendGrid, Mailgun) or a local Postfix instance.\\\\n   - Craft a convincing email with a link to the phishing domain. Use a spoofed \\u201cFrom\\u201d address that matches the target brand.\\\\n   - Include a short, urgent call\\u2011to\\u2011action and a realistic subject line.\\\\n\\\\n7. **Monitoring \\\\u0026 Reporting**\\\\n   - Set up a simple dashboard (e.g., Grafana + Loki) to view captured credentials in real time.\\\\n   - Configure alerts for high\\u2011volume credential submissions.\\\\n   - Ensure logs are retained only for the duration of the training and are securely deleted afterward.\\\\n\\\\n8. **Cleanup \\\\u0026 Decommission**\\\\n   - After the simulation, revoke the TLS certificate, delete DNS records, and wipe the server.\\\\n   - Remove all logs and any residual data to comply with privacy regulations.\\\\n\\\\n9. **Best Practices for Realism**\\\\n   - Use the same color scheme, typography, and layout as the real site.\\\\n   - Include subtle brand elements (logos, favicon, meta tags).\\\\n   - Add a \\u201cForgot password?\\u201d link that leads to a fake reset page.\\\\n   - Implement a CAPTCHA or two\\u2011factor prompt to mimic advanced login flows.\\\\n   - Test the site in multiple browsers and devices to ensure consistent appearance.\\\\n\\\\n10. **Legal \\\\u0026 Ethical Considerations**\\\\n   - Obtain written consent from all participants.\\\\n   - Ensure the simulation is conducted in a controlled environment with no external exposure.\\\\n   - Provide a clear debriefing session to explain the attack vector and mitigation strategies.\\\\n\\\\nBy following these steps, you create a realistic credential\\u2011theft phishing website that can effectively train employees to recognize and respond to such threats.\\\\n\\\",\\\"realism_level\\\":\\\"advanced\\\",\\\"simulation_type\\\":\\\"Credential Theft Phishing Website\\\"}\"\n  }\n]"

Use a reputable registrar that allows WHOIS privacy to avoid immediate detection.\\\\n   - Set up DNS records: A record pointing to your hosting IP, and optionally an MX record if you plan to receive emails.\\\\n   - Enable DNSSEC if your registrar supports it to add a layer of authenticity.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Hosting Environment**:\\\\n   - Use a VPS or cloud instance (AWS EC2, DigitalOcean Droplet, or Azure VM) with a public IP. Avoid shared hosting to reduce the risk of accidental exposure.\\\\n   - Install a LAMP/LEMP stack: Linux, Nginx/Apache, MySQL/MariaDB, PHP. Alternatively, use a static site host (Netlify, Vercel) if you only need a simple form.\\\\n   - Harden the server: disable unused services, set up a firewall (ufw/iptables), and use fail2ban.\\\\n\\\\n3. **SSL/TLS Setup**:\\\\n   - Obtain a free certificate from Let\\u2019s Encrypt.

Keep logos, color schemes, and navigation identical.\\\\n   - Replace the login form action with a custom endpoint on your server.\\\\n   - Add subtle cues: a small typo in the domain name, a missing favicon, or a slightly different logo to test user vigilance.\\\\n\\\\n5. **Form Handling**:\\\\n   - Create a PHP/Node.js/Go script that receives POST data (username, password, 2FA code if applicable).\\\\n   - Store credentials in a secure database or a simple encrypted file. Use a hashing algorithm (bcrypt) for any stored data you don\\u2019t need in plain text.\\\\n   - Log IP addresses, user-agent strings, and timestamps for analysis.\\\\n\\\\n6. **Redirection \\\\u0026 Response**:\\\\n   - After form submission, redirect the user to a legitimate-looking success page or the real login page to avoid suspicion.\\\\n   - Optionally, display a \\u201cLogin Successful\\u201d message with a countdown before redirecting.\\\\n\\\\n7. **Email Simulation (Optional)**:\\\\n   - Use a transactional email service (SendGrid, Mailgun) to send phishing emails with the malicious link.\\\\n   - Personalize the email with the recipient\\u2019s name and recent activity to increase credibility.\\\\n\\\\n8. **Monitoring \\\\u0026 Cleanup**:\\\\n   - Set up real-time alerts for form submissions via Slack or email.\\\\n   - After the training session, purge all captured credentials and delete the domain or set it to expire.\\\\n   - Ensure no residual data remains on the server or in backups.\\\\n\\\\n9. **Legal \\\\u0026 Ethical Considerations**:\\\\n   - Obtain written consent from all participants.\\\\n   - Keep the simulation strictly within the organization\\u2019s approved scope.\\\\n   - Provide a debriefing session to explain the attack vector and mitigation steps.\\\\n\\\\n10. **Post-Training Analysis**:\\\\n   - Generate reports on how many users fell for the phishing site.\\\\n   - Use the data to tailor future training modules.\\\\n\\\\n**Best Practices for Realism**:\\\\n- Use a domain that is only a single character off from the real domain.\\\\n- Mimic SSL certificate details (issuer, validity dates) to match the real site.\\\\n- Include subtle UI differences (e.g., button color, font size) to test user attention.\\\\n- Deploy the site on a subdomain of a legitimate domain you own to avoid DNS blacklisting.\\\\n- Use a realistic email template with proper headers and DKIM/SPF records.\\\\n- Keep the site\\u2019s uptime high; attackers often use fast\\u2011flux techniques, but for training, stability is key.\\\\n\\\\nBy following these steps, you create a realistic credential\\u2011theft phishing simulation that educates employees on recognizing subtle phishing cues and reinforces the importance of verifying URLs, checking SSL certificates, and reporting suspicious activity.\\\",\\\"realism_level\\\":\\\"advanced\\\",\\\"simulation_type\\\":\\\"Credential Theft Phishing Website\\\"}\"\n  }\n]"
